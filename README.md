# Sterna Studio

Sterna Studio is a student project I am using to explore the Foundations to SE course, aimed at creating a solution for renewable energy construstion sites. For the course, I am focusing on solo work of creating a website for the product.

## Project context 

The team project is focused on creation a solution that will simplify the communication between project owners, main contractors and subcontractors on the renewable energy construstion sites, in particular wind energy. The large number of subcontractors and the scale of construction sites results in numerous activities happening in parallel in a very fast pace environment. It makes it easy to loose track of hours spent on a specific task by a specific subcontractor and ends up in unnecessary extra cost, rather than analyzing whether subcontractors are spending their time productively. We are planning toy centralise, process and unifying paperwork to increase the overall productivity.

## Foundation project goals

Within foundations I will be working on creating a dynamic website presenting the product. I would like the website to have:
- a deep dive into the product and its features;
- information about the team with options to contact us through email or contact form;
- blog section to practice the concepts of dynamic websites learned within this course.
